# beautify-stats
This is a simple visuallizing tool I created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS with the main purpose of enhancing raw / boring stats for integration into presentations and reports.

The key features requested were: simple interface, colorful, and easy to screenshot. 

The user can simply fill out the 2 fields with a number and a description and generate a colorful box with their stat.  This can be repeated multiple times and will produce multiple boxes with alternating colors.

Like this:

I've added extra padding around the stat area to easily select the boxes using the screenshot tool of your choice.

I was able to back-engineer and repurpose components from a to-do app project to help build out this tool saving valuable time and meeting the deadline.
