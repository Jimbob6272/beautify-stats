# beautify-stats
This is a simple visuallizing tool I created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS with the main purpose of enhancing raw / boring stats for integration into presentations and reports.

The idea was to create an easy way to quickly generate an interesting visual using a few simple stats.

I got part of the idea for how to start creating the tool while following an online javascript todo list project:

I was able to back-engineer and repurpose parts of the code created during the project to help build some parts of this tool.
